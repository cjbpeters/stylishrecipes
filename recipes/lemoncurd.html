    <p>Here I will be introducing my arguably reckless strategy for turning out delicous lemon and mixed citrus curds. I will be writing this up as a pure lemon curd recipe, but replacing some of the zest and juice with limes, oranges and even grapefruit can yield beautiful results.</p>
    <p>What makes the curd reckless? While other than bumping up the citrus kick compared to other recipes, I also don't use a double boiler. Cook this curd quickly and attentively, and pass it through a chinoise just in case you do curdle slightly. Let's get started. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>7 egg yolks, 1 full egg</li>
        <li>300 g sugar</li>
        <li>zest of 4 to 5 lemons, size dependent</li>
        <li>juice pf 7-9 lemons, size dependent</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>175 g butter, room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Zest your lemons. I like to do this directly into my weighed out sugar to capture as much oil as possible.</li>
        <li>Seperate out your egg yolks, add your whole egg and set aside. Consider reserving your whites for merinques, can be a classic and texturally pleasant companion to dishes using your lemon curd.</li>
        <li>Juice your lemons, set juice aside.</li>
        <li>Combine your sugar and lemon zest in a vitamix or other powerful blender. You may be able to do this in a food processor in a pinch.</li>
        <li>Buzz sugar and zest until they start to form a citrus sugar. Break down as much as possible but don't worry if you are not yet able to achieve a uniform texture at this stage.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, around a third at a time and blend to incorporate. At this stage you are looking to create a uniform texture. Try not to allow it to overwork however.</li>
        <li>Gradually add around 2/3 of your lemon juice to the blender, thinning and smoothing your egg and citrus sugar blend.</li>
        <li>Heat a thick bottomed saucepan to medium low heat. Pour in the contents of your blender and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken.</li>
        <li>Add your salt and the remaining lemon juice, stirring constanty, until you have a ribbonly curd like texture with a poweful lemon kick. Don't let it turn to scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Cut the heat and stir in your butter in 6 to egg small pieces until uniformly textured. Pour curd through a chinoise into a mixing bowl, cover and place in a fridge to cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This curd is wonderful by itself, on icecream, drizzled over cakes or fresh fruit or many other applications. Consider making merinque cookies and topping a pound cake or chiffon cake with curd and crumbled cookies for a strikingly textured desert.</p>
